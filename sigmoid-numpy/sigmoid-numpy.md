## What the Sigmoid Function Does

The sigmoid function squashes any real number into the range $(0, 1)$:

$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

No matter how large or small the input, the output is always between 0 and 1 (exclusive). This makes sigmoid ideal for representing **probabilities**.

## The Shape of Sigmoid

The sigmoid curve is an S-shape (the word "sigmoid" comes from the Greek letter sigma, which looks like an S):

- For large negative inputs: output approaches 0
- For large positive inputs: output approaches 1
- At $x = 0$: output is exactly 0.5

Some concrete values:

- $\sigma(-10) \approx 0.000045$ (very close to 0)
- $\sigma(-5) \approx 0.0067$
- $\sigma(-2) \approx 0.119$
- $\sigma(-1) \approx 0.269$
- $\sigma(0) = 0.5$ (exactly)
- $\sigma(1) \approx 0.731$
- $\sigma(2) \approx 0.881$
- $\sigma(5) \approx 0.9933$
- $\sigma(10) \approx 0.999955$ (very close to 1)

## Why Sigmoid Outputs Probabilities

The formula $\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ guarantees:

1. **Always positive**: $e^{-x} > 0$ for all $x$, so the denominator $1 + e^{-x} > 1$, making the fraction positive
2. **Always less than 1**: The denominator is always greater than 1, so the fraction is less than 1
3. **Monotonically increasing**: As $x$ increases, $e^{-x}$ decreases, so the fraction increases

These properties make sigmoid perfect for converting raw model outputs (logits) into probabilities for binary classification.

## The Derivative of Sigmoid

The derivative has an elegant form:

$$
\frac{d\sigma}{dx} = \sigma(x) \cdot (1 - \sigma(x))
$$

This means once you compute $\sigma(x)$, the gradient is essentially free to calculate.

**Derivative values:**

- At $x = 0$: derivative $= 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25$ (maximum)
- At $x = 2$: derivative $= 0.881 \times 0.119 \approx 0.105$
- At $x = 5$: derivative $\approx 0.0066$ (very small)

The gradient is largest at $x = 0$ and quickly shrinks as you move away from zero. This causes the **vanishing gradient problem** in deep networks.

## Numerical Stability

Computing $e^{-x}$ directly can overflow for large negative $x$ (since $e^{-(-1000)} = e^{1000} = \infty$).

A numerically stable implementation handles positive and negative inputs differently:

For $x \geq 0$:
$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

For $x < 0$:
$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}
$$

Both formulas are mathematically equivalent, but the second avoids computing $e^{-x}$ when $x$ is a large negative number.

## Sigmoid vs. Other Activations

**Sigmoid:**
- Range: $(0, 1)$
- Gradient at 0: 0.25
- Used in: output layers for binary classification, gating mechanisms

**Tanh:**
- Range: $(-1, 1)$
- Gradient at 0: 1.0
- Used in: hidden layers (legacy), LSTM/GRU internal states

**ReLU:**
- Range: $[0, \infty)$
- Gradient: 1.0 for $x > 0$, 0 for $x < 0$
- Used in: hidden layers (modern default since 2012)

Tanh is a rescaled sigmoid: $\tanh(x) = 2\sigma(2x) - 1$. It is zero-centered (outputs range from $-1$ to $1$), which often leads to faster convergence than sigmoid in hidden layers.

ReLU ($\max(0, x)$) solved the vanishing gradient problem for deep networks. Its gradient is either 0 or 1, so gradients flow without shrinking through the positive regime. It became the default hidden-layer activation starting around 2012.

Sigmoid remains the right choice for outputs that need to represent probabilities or for gating mechanisms that need smooth $[0, 1]$ control signals.

## Where Sigmoid Is Used Today

**Binary classification output layer:**

The final layer of a binary classifier typically outputs a single logit, and sigmoid converts it to a probability:

$$
P(y = 1 | x) = \sigma(\text{logit})
$$

**Gating mechanisms:**

In LSTMs and GRUs, sigmoid gates control information flow:

- Forget gate: decides what to discard from cell state
- Input gate: decides what new information to store
- Output gate: decides what to output

These gates need values in $[0, 1]$ to act as "soft switches" (0 = block, 1 = pass through).

**Attention weights:**

Some attention mechanisms use sigmoid instead of softmax when attention weights should be independent (not sum to 1).

**Multi-label classification:**

When each class is independent (an image can have multiple labels), apply sigmoid to each output independently rather than using softmax across all classes.
